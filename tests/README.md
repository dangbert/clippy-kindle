# Unit Tests

This folder implements unit tests for testing that the files in `./examples/` parse as expected, and to serve as regression tests to ensure that any output changes in the future are intentional.

Run tests with the `pytest` command from either this directory or the root project directory (after setting up python environment).  Use `pytest -v -s` for verbose output.
